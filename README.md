# CPSC_411-HW1
How to run HW1:

There are two modes to run:

1. An all XML formatted table named "linear_layout.xml" built by the java file "LinearActivity.java"

2. An XML/java hybrid table named "Java_plusXMLActivity.java" with the formatted by "linear_root.XML"

The Android Manifest XML line 12 should be set to: 
      
      <activity android:name=".[JAVA_FILE]"> 
      
where JAVA_FILE = LinearActivity to run the first version and JAVA_FILE = Java_plusXMLActivity to run the second version.
